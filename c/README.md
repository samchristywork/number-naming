## Overview

C version of this program. Build with `make` and run with
`./build/name_large_numbers`.

## Dependencies

```
gcc
make
```

## Future work

I plan on adding support for command line arguments so that the user can
specify a number, or generate a number of a certain length, or specify the
output format.

I also want to create some kind of test harness.
